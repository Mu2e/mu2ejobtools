This package contains tools for creating and using Mu2e "job
parameter" files.  A job parameter file defines a (finite or infinite)
set of jobs, which can be run on the grid, or otherwise, in a
reproducible way.

Before using the mu2ejobdef script one need to setup the fhiclcpp
package and FHICL_FILE_PATH environment variable.  This is usually
accomplished by setting up Mu2e Offline.
